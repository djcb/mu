  "The list of all the possible marks.
This is an alist mapping mark symbols to their properties.  The
properties are:
  :char (string) or (basic . fancy) The character to display in
    the headers view. Either a single-character string, or a
    dotted-pair cons cell where the second item will be used if
    `mu4e-use-fancy-chars' is `t', otherwise we'll use
    the first one. It can also be a plain string for backwards
    compatibility since we didn't always support
    `mu4e-use-fancy-chars' here.
  :prompt (string) The prompt to use when asking for marks (used for
     example when marking a whole thread)
  :ask-target (function returning a string) Get the target.  This
     function run once per bulk-operation, and thus is suitable
     for user-interaction.  If nil, the target is nil.
  :dyn-target (function from (TARGET MSG) to string).  Compute
     the dynamic target.  This is run once per message, which is
     passed as MSG.  The default is to just return the target.
  :show-target (function from TARGET to string) How to display
     the target.
  :action (function taking (DOCID MSG TARGET)).  The action to
     apply on the message.")

  "An alist of all possible header fields and information about them.
This is used in the user-interface (the column headers in the header list, and
the fields the message view).

Most fields should be self-explanatory. A special one is
`:from-or-to', which is equal to `:from' unless `:from' matches one
of the addresses in `mu4e-user-mail-address-list', in which case it
will be equal to `:to'.

Furthermore, the property `:sortable' determines whether we can
sort by this field.  This can be either a boolean (nil or t), or a
symbol for /another/ field. For example, the `:human-date' field
uses `:date' for that.

Fields with which have the property `:require-full' set to
non-nil require a full message; in practice this means that you
cannot use such fieds as part of `mu4e-headers-fields', but only
in `mu4e-view-fields.'

Note, `:sortable' is not supported for custom header fields.")

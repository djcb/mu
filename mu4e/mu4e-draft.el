Note, when using GMail/IMAP, you should set this to either
`trash' or `delete', since GMail already takes care of keeping
copies in the sent folder.

Alternatively, `mu4e-sent-messages-behavior' can be a function
which takes no arguments, and which should return one of the mentioned

The value is a list, whose members determine the behaviour of

- `sign-new-messages': Add a signature to new message, ie.
  messages that aren't responses to another message.
- `sign-forwarded-messages': Add a signature when forwarding
  a message

- `sign-all-replies': Add a signature when responding to
  another message.
- `sign-plain-replies': Add a signature when responding to
  non-encrypted messages.
- `sign-encrypted-replies': Add a signature when responding
  to encrypted messages.

It should be noted that certain symbols have priorities over one
another. So `sign-all-messages' implies `sign-all-replies', which
in turn implies `sign-plain-replies'. Adding both to the set, is
not a contradiction, but a redundant configuration.

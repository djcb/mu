  "Function to rewrite a query.

It takes a search expression string, and returns a possibly
  changed search expression string.

This function is applied on the search expression just before
searching, and allows users to modify the query.

For instance, we could change any instance of \"workmail\" into
\"maildir:/long-path-to-work-related-emails\", by setting the function

\\=(setq mu4e-query-rewrite-function
  (lambda(expr)
     (replace-regexp-in-string \"workmail\"
                   \"maildir:/long-path-to-work-related-emails\" expr)))

It is good to remember that the replacement does not understand
anything about the query, it just does text replacement.

A word of caution: the function should be deterministic and
always return the same result for a given query (at least within
some \"context\" (see `mu4e-context'). If not, you may get incorrect results
for the various unread counts."

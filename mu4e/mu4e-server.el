When moving messages to different folders, normally mu/mu4e keep
the base filename the same (the flags-part of the filename may

changes the filename.

This latter behavior works better with some

better with e.g. offlineimap."

Some commands - in particular \"find\" and \"contacts\" - return
big s-expressions; and it turns out that reading those is faster
by passing them through a temp file rather than through normal
stdin/stdout channel - esp. on the (common case) where the
file-system for temp-files is in-memory.

To see if the helps, you can benchmark the rendering with
     (setq mu4e-headers-report-render-time t)

and compare the results with `mu4e-mu-allow-temp' set and unset.

Note: for a change to this variable to take effect, you need to

    like :header

   => the <msg-sexp> (see 2.) will be passed to
   `mu4e-update-func', :move tells us whether this is a move to
   another maildir, or merely a flag change.

  5. a remove looks like:
  (:remove <docid>)

  6. a compose looks like:
  (:compose <reply|forward|edit|new> [:original<msg-sexp>] [:include <attach>])

At least one of MAILDIR and FLAGS must be specified. Note that
even when MAILDIR is nil, this is still a filesystem move, since
a change in flags implies a change in message filename.

MAILDIR must be a maildir, that is, the part _without_ cur/ or new/
or the root-maildir-prefix. E.g. \"/archive\". This directory must
already exist.

The FLAGS parameter can have the following forms:
  1. a list of flags such as `(passed replied seen)'
  2. a string containing the one-char versions of the flags, e.g. \"PRS\"
  3. a delta-string specifying the changes with +/- and the one-char flags,
     e.g. \"+S-N\" to set Seen and remove New.

The flags are any of `deleted', `flagged', `new', `passed', `replied' `seen' or
`trashed', or the corresponding \"DFNPRST\" as defined in [1]. See
`mu4e-string-to-flags' and `mu4e-flags-to-string'.
The server reports the results for the operation through
`mu4e-update-func'.

If the variable `mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving' is
non-nil, moving to a different maildir generates new names forq
the target files; this helps certain tools (such as mbsync).

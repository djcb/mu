;;; Commentary:

;; In this file, various functions to compose/send messages, piggybacking on
;; gnus' message mode

;; Magic / Rupe Goldberg

;; 1) When we reply/forward a message, we get it from the backend, ie:
;; we send to the backend (mu4e-compose):
;;     compose type:reply docid:30935
;; backend responds with:
;;      (:compose reply :original ( .... <original message> ))

;; 2) When we compose a message, message and headers are separated by
;; `mail-header-separator', ie. '--text follows this line--. We use
;; before-save-hook and after-save-hook to remove/re-add this special line, so
;; it stays in the buffer, but never hits the disk.
;; see:
;;     mu4e~compose-insert-mail-header-separator
;;     mu4e~compose-remove-mail-header-separator
;;
;; (maybe we can get away with remove it only just before sending? what does
;; gnus do?)

;; 3) When sending a message, we want to do a few things:
;;   a) move the message from drafts to the sent folder (maybe; depends on
;;      `mu4e-sent-messages-behavior')
;;   b) if it's a reply, mark the replied-to message as "R", i.e. replied
;;      if it's a forward, mark the forwarded message as "P", i.e.
;;      passed (forwarded)
;;   c) kill all buffers looking at the sent message

;;  a) is dealt with by message-mode, but we need to tell it where to move the
;;     sent message. We do this by adding an Fcc: header with the target folder,
;;     see `mu4e~compose-setup-fcc-maybe'. Since message-mode does not natively
;;     understand maildirs, we also need to tell it what to do, so we also set
;;     `message-fcc-handler-function' there. Finally, we add the the message in
;;     the sent-folder to the database.
;;
;;   b) this is handled in `mu4e~compose-set-parent-flag'
;;
;;   c) this is handled in our handler for the `sent'-message from the backend
;;   (`mu4e-sent-handler')

;;; Misc

;; 'fcc' refers to saving a copy of a sent message to a certain folder. that's

;; what these 'Sent mail' folders are for!
;;
;; We let message mode take care of this by adding a field

;;   Fcc: <full-path-to-message-in-target-folder>

;; in the "message-send-hook" (ie., just before sending).  message mode will
;; then take care of the saving when the message is actually sent.
;;
;; note, where and if you make this copy depends on the value of
;; `mu4e-sent-messages-behavior'.

  "Function to be used to receive user-input during completion.

Suggested possible values are:
 * `completing-read':      emacs built-in completion method
 * `ido-completing-read':  dynamic completion within the minibuffer.

The function is used in two contexts -
1) directly - for instance in when listing _other_ maildirs
   in `mu4e-ask-maildir'
2) if  `mu4e-read-option-use-builtin' is nil, it is used
   as part of `mu4e-read-option' in many places.

Set it to `completing-read' when you want to use completion
frameworks such as Helm, Ivy or Vertico. In that case, you
might want to add soemthing like the following in your configuration.

   (setq mu4e-read-option-use-builtin nil
         mu4e-completing-read-function \\='completing-read)

If nil, use the value of `mu4e-completing-read-function', integrated
into mu4e.

Many of the third-party completion frameworks - such as Helm, Ivy
and Vertico - influence `completion-read', so to have mu4e follow
your overall settings, try the equivalent of

   (setq mu4e-read-option-use-builtin nil
         mu4e-completing-read-function \\='completing-read)

Tastes differ, but without any such frameworks, the unaugmented
Emacs `completing-read' is rather Spartan."

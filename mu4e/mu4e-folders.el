  "A list of maildir shortcuts.
This makes it possible to quickly go to a particular
maildir (folder), or quickly moving messages to them (e.g., for
archiving or refiling).

Each of the list elements is a plist with at least:
`:maildir'  - the maildir for the shortcut (e.g. \"/archive\")
`:key'      - the shortcut key.

Optionally, you can add the following:
`:name' - name of the maildir to be displayed in main-view.
`:hide'  - if t, the shortcut is hidden from the main-view and
speedbar.
`:hide-unread' - do not show the counts of unread/total number
 of matches for the maildir in the main-view, and is implied
from `:hide'.

For backward compatibility, an older form is recognized as well:

   (maildir . key), where MAILDIR is a maildir (such as
\"/archive/\"), and key is a single character.

You can use these shortcuts in the headers and view buffers, for
example with `mu4e-mark-for-move-quick' (or \"m\", by default) or
`mu4e-jump-to-maildir' (or \"j\", by default), followed by the
designated shortcut character for the maildir.

Unlike in search queries, folder names with spaces in them must
NOT be quoted, since mu4e does this for you."

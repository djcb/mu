  "List of pre-defined queries that are shown on the main screen.

Each of the list elements is a plist with at least:
`:name'  - the name of the query
`:query' - the query expression string or function
`:key'   - the shortcut key (single character)

Optionally, you can add the following:

- `:favorite' - if t, monitor the results of this query, and make
it eligible for showing its status in the modeline. At most
one bookmark should have this set to t (otherwise the _first_
bookmark is the implicit favorite). The query for the `:favorite'
item must be unique among `mu4e-bookmarks' and
`mu4e-maildir-shortcuts'.
- `:hide' - if t, the bookmark is hidden from the main-view and
speedbar.
- `:hide-unread' - do not show the counts of
unread/total number of matches for the query in the main-view.
This can be useful if a bookmark uses a very slow query.

`:hide-unread' is implied from `:hide'.

Note: for efficiency, queries used to determine the unread/all
counts do not discard duplicate or unreadable messages. Thus, the
numbers shown may differ from the number you get from a normal
query."

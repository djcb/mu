;;; Commentary:

;; To install:
;; (require 'mu4e-icalendar)
;; (mu4e-icalendar-setup)
;; Optional
;; (setq mu4e-icalendar-trash-after-reply t)

;; By default, the original message is not cited.  However, if you
;; would like to reply to it, the citation is in the kill-ring (paste
;; it with `yank').

;; To add the event to a diary file of your choice:
;; (setq mu4e-icalendar-diary-file "/path/to/your/diary")
;; If the file specified is not your main diary file, add
;; #include "/path/to/your/diary"
;; to you main diary file to display the events.

;; To enable optional iCalendar->Org sync functionality
;; NOTE: both the capture file and the headline(s) inside must already exist
;; (require 'org-agenda)
;; (setq gnus-icalendar-org-capture-file "~/org/notes.org")
;; (setq gnus-icalendar-org-capture-headline '("Calendar"))
;; (gnus-icalendar-org-setup)

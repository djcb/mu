** Development

*** mu

    - truncate /all/ terms the go beyond xapian's max term length
    - lowercase the domain-part of email addresses in mu cfind (and mu4e), if
      the domain is in ascii
    - give messages without msgids fake-message-ids; this fixes the problem
      where such messages were not found in --include-related queries


** Release 0.9.9.5

*** mu

     - allow 'contact:' as a shortcut in queries for 'from:foo OR to:foo OR
       cc:foo OR bcc:foo', and 'recip:' as a shortcut for 'to:foo OR
       cc:foo OR bcc:foo'
     - support getting related messages (--include-related), which includes
       messages that may not match the query, but that are in the same threads
       as messages that were
     - support "list:"/"v:" for matching mailing list names, and the "v"
       format-field to show them. E.g 'mu find list:emacs-orgmode.gnu.org'

*** mu4e

    - scroll down in message view takes you to next message (but see
      `mu4e-view-scroll-to-next')
    - support 'human dates', that is, show the time for today's messages, and
      the date for older messages in the headers view
    - replace `mu4e-user-mail-address-regexp' and `mu4e-my-mail-addresses' with
      `mu4e-user-mail-address-list'
    - support tags (i.e.., X-Keywords and friends) in the headers-view, and the
      message view. Thanks to Abdó Roig-Maranges. New field ":tags".
    - automatically update the headers buffer when new messages are found during
      indexing; set `mu4e-headers-auto-update' to nil to disable this.
    - update mail/index with M-x mu4e-update-mail-and-index; which everywhere in
      mu4e is available with key C-S-u. Use prefix argument to run in
      background.
    - add function `mu4e-update-index' to only update the index
    - add 'friendly-names' for mailing lists, so they should up nicely in the
      headers view

*** guile

    - add 'mu script' command to run mu script, for example to do statistics on
      your message corpus. See the mu-script man-page.

*** mug

    - ported to gtk+ 3; remove gtk+ 2.x code

     attachment, or 'flag:encrypted' for encrypted messages
   - you can search for time-intervals, e.g. 'date:2010-11-26..2010-11-29' for

     up-to-n lines of the message
   - Same for 'mu view'; the summary replaces the full body
   - Setting the mu home dir now goes with -m, --muhome

     --linksdir, --clearlinks lost their single char version

   - Automatic database scheme version check, notifies users when an upgrade
     is needed
   - 'mu view', to view mail message files

     by upgraded (--autoupgrade). Also, the log file is automatically cleaned

     example, you can find all messages located in ~/Maildir/foo/bar/cur/msg
     ~/Maildir/foo/bar/new/msg and with
	m:/foo/bar
     this replace the search for path/p in 0.6

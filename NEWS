   - add 'flag:unread' as a synonym for 'flag:new OR NOT flag:unseen'

   - don't warn about missing files with --quiet
   
** Release 0.9.2 <2011-02-02 Wed>

   - stricter checking of options; and options must now *follow* the sub-command
     (if any); so, something like: 'mu index --maildir=/foo/bar'
   - output searches as plain text (default), XML, JSON or s-expressions using 
     --format=plain|xml|json|sexp. For example: 'mu find foobar
     --output=json'. These format options  are experimental (except for 'plain')
   - the --xquery option should now be used as --format=xquery, for output
     symlinks, use --format=links. This is a change in the options.
   - search output can include the message size using the 'z' shortcut
   - match message size ranges (i.e.. size:500k..2M)
   - fix: honor the --overwrite (or lack thereof) parameter
   - support folder names with special characters (@, ' ', '.' and so on)
   - better check for already-running mu index
   - when --maildir= is not provided for mu index, default to the last one
   - add --max-msg-size, to specify a new maximum message size
   - move the 'mug' UI to toys/mug; no longer installable
   - better support for Solaris builds, Gentoo.

** Release 0.9.1 <2010-12-05 Sun>
   
   - Add missing icon for mug 
   - Fix unit tests (Issue #30)
   - Fix Fedora 14 build (broken GTK+ 3) (Issue #31)
     
** Release 0.9 <2010-12-04 Sat>
   
   - you can now search for the message priority ('prio:high', 'prio:low',
     'prio:normal')
   - you can now search for message flags, e.g. 'flag:attach' for messages with
     attachment, or 'flag:encrypted' for encrypted messages
   - you can search for time-intervals, e.g. 'date:2010-11-26..2010-11-29' for
     messages in that range. See the mu-find(1) and mu-easy(1) man-pages for
     details and examples.
   - you can store bookmarked queries in ~/.mu/bookmarks
   - the 'flags' parameter has been renamed in 'flag'
   - add a simple graphical UI for searching, called 'mug'
   - fix --clearlinks for file systems without entry->d_type (fixes issue #28)
   - make matching case-insensitive and accent-insensitive (accent-insensitive
     for characters in Unicode Blocks 'Latin-1 Supplement' and 'Latin
     Extended-A')
   - more extensive pre-processing is done to make searching for email-addresses
     and message-ids less likely to not work (issue #21)
   - updated the man-pages
   - experimental support for Fedora 14, which uses GMime 2.5.x (fixes issue #29)

** Release 0.8 <2010-10-30 Sat>
   
   - There's now 'mu extract' for getting information about MIME-parts
     (attachments) and extracting them
   - Queries are now internally converted to lowercase; this solves some of the
     false-negative issues
   - All mu sub-commands now have their own man-page
   - 'mu find' now takes a --summary-len=<n> argument to print a summary of
     up-to-n lines of the message
   - Same for 'mu view'; the summary replaces the full body
   - Setting the mu home dir now goes with -m, --muhome
   - --log-stderr, --reindex, --rebuild, --autoupgrade, --nocleanup, --mode,
     --linksdir, --clearlinks lost their single char version
     
** Release 0.7 <2010-02-27 Sat>

   - Database format changed
   - Automatic database scheme version check, notifies users when an upgrade
     is needed
   - 'mu view', to view mail message files
   - Support for >10K matches
   - Support for unattended upgrades - that is, the database can automatically
     by upgraded (--autoupgrade). Also, the log file is automatically cleaned
     when it gets too big (unless you use --nocleanup)
   - Search for a certain Maildir using the maildir:,m: search prefixes. For
     example, you can find all messages located in ~/Maildir/foo/bar/cur/msg
     ~/Maildir/foo/bar/new/msg and with
	m:/foo/bar
     this replace the search for path/p in 0.6
   - Fixes for reported issues ()
   - A test suite with a growing number of unit tests

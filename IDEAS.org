* IDEAS

Ideas for future enhancements. We collect those here so they don't clutter up
the Github issue list, i.e. without any clear plan for adding in the near
future.

- Support automatic handling for List-Unsubscribe headers
  https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/2623 This seems useful, but probably
  requires a lot of testing to get right.

- Allow for *muting* messages https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/636 Useful;
  probably need to do this by *remembering* the thread-id of muted messages; and
  management (unmute etc.). Perhaps at the mu side, a list of thread-id to add
  to each query for what *not* to match.

- Support *creating* calendar invitations.
  https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/2308
  Shouldn't be _too_ hard, for someone that uses the functionality.

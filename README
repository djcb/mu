Welcome to mu & mu4e!

*Note*: you are looking at the *development* branch, which is where new code is being developed and
tested, and which may occasionally break.

Distribution and non-adventurous users are instead recommended to use the [1.4.x Release
Branch](https://github.com/djcb/mu/tree/release/1.4.x) or to pick up one of the [1.4.x
releases](https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases).

Given the enormous amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance of e-mail message in our
work-flows, it's essential to quickly deal with all that mail - in particular, to instantly find
that one important e-mail you need right now, and quickly file away message for later use.

`mu` is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the Maildir-format. `mu`'s purpose in life
is to help you to quickly find the messages you need; in addition, it allows you to view messages,
extract attachments, create new maildirs, and so on. See the [mu cheatsheet] for some examples. =mu=
is fully documented.

After indexing your messages into a [Xapian](http://www.xapian.org)-database, you can search them
using a custom query language. You can use various message fields or words in the body text to find
the right messages.

Built on top of `mu` are some extensions (included in this package):

  * mu4e: a full-featured e-mail client that runs inside emacs

  * mu-guile: bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language (version 2.2 and later)

`mu` is written in C and C++; `mu4e` is written in elisp, and `mu-guile` in a mix of C and Scheme.

Note, `mu` is available in Linux distributions (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora) under the name
`maildir-utils`; apparently because they don't like short names.

Welcome to mu! 
---------------

  Given the enormous amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance of
  e-mail message in our work-flows, it's essential to quickly deal with all that
  mail - in particular, to instantly find that one important e-mail you need right
  now.
  
  [mu] is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the
  Maildir-format. =mu='s purpose in life is to help you to quickly find the
  messages you need; in addition, it allows you to view messages, extract
  attachments, create new maildirs, and so on. See the [mu cheatsheet] for some
  examples. =mu= is fully documented.
  
  After indexing your messages into a [Xapian]-database, you can search them using
  a custom query language. You can use various message fields or words in the
  body text to find the right messages.
  
  Built on top of =mu= are some extensions (included in this package):

  - mu-for-emacs ([mu4e]): a full-featured e-mail client that runs inside emacs
  - [mu-guile]: bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language (version 2.0
    and later)
  - a toy GTK+-interface called 'mug' (in the 'toys/' subdir)

  =mu= is written in C and a bit of C++ (to interface with Xapian), with =mu4e=
  written in [Emacs-Lisp] and =mu-guile= in a mix of C and Scheme.
  
  Note, =mu= is available in Debian/Ubuntu under the name =maildir-utils=;
  apparently because they don't like short names. It's also possible to confuse
  that name with the [GNU Mailutils] project (which is totally unrelated) - but
  now you have been warned.

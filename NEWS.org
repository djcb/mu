** 0.9.15

   - bump version to 0.9.15. From now on, odd minor version numbers are for development versions;
     thus, 0.9.16 is to be the next stable release.
   - special case text/calendar attachements to get .vcs
     extensions. This makes it easier to process those with external
     tools.
   - change the message file names to better conform to the maildir
     spec; this was confusing some tools.
   - fix navigation when not running in split-view mode
   - add mu4e-view-body-face, so the body-face for message in the view can be customized; e.g.
      (set-face-attribute 'mu4e-view-body-face nil :font "Liberation Serif-10")
  
** 0.9.13

*** mu/mu4e/guile

    - NEWS (this file) is now visible from within mu4e – "N" in the main-menu.
      
    - make `mu4e-headers-sort-field', `mu4e-headers-sort-direction'
      public (that, is change the prefix from mu4e~ to mu4e-), so
      users can manipulate them
      
    - make it possible the 'fancy' (unicode) characters separately for
      headers and marks (see the variable `mu4e-use-fancy-chars'.)
      
    - allow for composing in a separate frame (see
      `mu4e-compose-in-new-frame')
      
    - add the `:thread-subject' header field, for showing the subject
      for a thread only once. So, instead of (from the manual):

      This is a feature known from e.g. `mutt' and `gnus` and many
      other clients, and can be enabled by customizing
      `mu4e-headers-fields' (replacing `:subject' with `:thread-subject')
      
      It's not the default yet, but may become so in the future.
     
    - add some spam-handling actions to mu4e-contrib.el
      
    - mu4e now targets org 8.x, which support for previous versions
      relegated to `org-old-mu4e.el`. Some of the new org-features are
      improved capture templates.
      
    - updates to the documentation, in particular about using BBDB.
           
    - improved URL-handling (use emacs built-in functionality)
    
    - many bug fixes, including some crash fixes on BSD
      
*** guile

    – add --delete option to the find-dups scripts, to automatically
    delete them. Use with care!

** Release 0.9.12

*** mu

    - truncate /all/ terms the go beyond xapian's max term length
    - lowercase the domain-part of email addresses in mu cfind (and mu4e), if
      the domain is in ascii
    - give messages without msgids fake-message-ids; this fixes the problem
      where such messages were not found in --include-related queries
    - cleanup of the query parser
    - provide fake message-ids for messages without it; fixes #183
    - allow showing tags in 'mu find' output
    - fix CSV quoting
    - 

*** mu4e

    - update the emacs <-> backend protocol; documented in the mu-server man page
    - show 'None' as date for messages without it (Headers View)
    - add `mu4e-headers-found-hook', `mu4e-update-pre-hook'.
    - split org support in org-old-mu4e.el (org <= 7.x) and org-mu4e.el
    - org: improve template keywords
    - rework URL handling

** Release 0.9.5

*** mu

     - allow 'contact:' as a shortcut in queries for 'from:foo OR to:foo OR
       cc:foo OR bcc:foo', and 'recip:' as a shortcut for 'to:foo OR
       cc:foo OR bcc:foo'
     - support getting related messages (--include-related), which includes
       messages that may not match the query, but that are in the same threads
       as messages that were
     - support "list:"/"v:" for matching mailing list names, and the "v"
       format-field to show them. E.g 'mu find list:emacs-orgmode.gnu.org'

*** mu4e

    - scroll down in message view takes you to next message (but see
      `mu4e-view-scroll-to-next')
    - support 'human dates', that is, show the time for today's messages, and
      the date for older messages in the headers view
    - replace `mu4e-user-mail-address-regexp' and `mu4e-my-mail-addresses' with
      `mu4e-user-mail-address-list'
    - support tags (i.e.., X-Keywords and friends) in the headers-view, and the
      message view. Thanks to Abdó Roig-Maranges. New field ":tags".
    - automatically update the headers buffer when new messages are found during
      indexing; set `mu4e-headers-auto-update' to nil to disable this.
    - update mail/index with M-x mu4e-update-mail-and-index; which everywhere in
      mu4e is available with key C-S-u. Use prefix argument to run in
      background.
    - add function `mu4e-update-index' to only update the index
    - add 'friendly-names' for mailing lists, so they should up nicely in the
      headers view

*** guile

    - add 'mu script' command to run mu script, for example to do statistics on
      your message corpus. See the mu-script man-page.

*** mug

    - ported to gtk+ 3; remove gtk+ 2.x code

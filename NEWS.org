* NEWS (user visible changes)

** 0.9.18

   New development series which will lead to 0.9.18.

*** mu

   - Increase the default maximum size for messages to index to 500
     Mb; you can customize this using the --max-msg-size parameter to
     mu index.
   - implement "lazy-checking", which makes mu not descend into
     subdirectories when the directory-timestamp is up to date;
     greatly speeds up indexing (see --lazy-check)
   - prefer gpg2 for crypto
   - fix a crash when running on OpenBSD
   - fix --clear-links (broken filenames)
    
*** mu4e

**** reading messages
     
   - Add `mu4e-action-view-with-xwidget`, and action for viewing
     e-mails inside a Webkit-widget inside emacs (requires emacs 25.x
     with xwidget/webkit/gtk3 support)
   - Explicitly specify utf8 for external html viewing, so browsers
     can handle it correctly.
   - Make `shr' the default renderer for rich-text emails (when
     available)
   - Add a :user-agent field to the message-sexp (in mu4e-view), which
     is either the User-Agent or X-Mailer field, when present.

**** composing messages
     
   - Cleanly handle early exits from message composition as well as
     while composing.
   - Allow for resending existing messages, possibly editing them. M-x
     mu4e-compose-resend, or use the menu; no shortcut.
   - Better handle the closing of separate compose frames
   - Improved font-locking for the compose buffers, and more extensive
     checks for cited parts.
   - automatically sign/encrypt replies to signed/encrypted messages
     (subject to `mu4e-compose-crypto-reply-policy')

**** searching & marking

   - Add a hook `mu4e-mark-execute-pre-hook`, which is run just before
     executing marks.
   - Just before executing any search, a hook-function
     `mu4e-headers-search-hook` is invoked, which receives the
     search expression as its parameter.
   - In addition, there's a `mu4e-headers-search-bookmark-hook` which
     gets called when searches get invoked as a bookmark (note that
     `mu4e-headers-search-hook` will also be called just
     afterwards). This hook also receives the search expression as its
     parameter.
   - Remove the 'z' keybinding for leaving the headers
     view. Keybindings are precious!
   - Fix parentheses/precedence in narrowing search terms

**** indexing
     
   - Allow for indexing in the background; see
     `mu4e-index-update-in-background`.
   - Better handle mbsync output in the update buffer
   - Add variables mu4e-index-cleanup and mu4e-index-lazy to enable
     lazy checking from mu4e; you can sit from mu4e using something
     like:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq
  mu4e-index-cleanup nil      ;; don't do a full cleanup check
  mu4e-index-lazy-check t)    ;; don't consider up-to-date dirs
#+END_SRC

**** misc
     
   - don't overwrite global-mode-string, append to it.
   - Make org-links (and more general, all users of
     mu4e-view-message-with-message-id) use a headers buffer, then
     view the message. This way, those linked message are just like
     any other, and can be deleted, moved etc.
   - Support org-mode 9.x
   - Improve file-name escaping, and make it support non-ascii filenames
   - Attempt to jump to the same messages after a re-search update operation
   - Add action for spam-filter options
   - Let `mu4e~read-char-choice' become case-insensitive if there is
     no exact match; small convenience that affects most the
     single-char option-reading in mu4e.

*** Perl

   - an experimental Perl binding ("mup") is available now. See
     perl/README.md for details.

** 0.9.15

   - bump version to 0.9.15. From now on, odd minor version numbers
     are for development versions; thus, 0.9.16 is to be the next
     stable release.
   - special case text/calendar attachements to get .vcs
     extensions. This makes it easier to process those with external
     tools.
   - change the message file names to better conform to the maildir
     spec; this was confusing some tools.
   - fix navigation when not running in split-view mode
   - add `mu4e-view-body-face', so the body-face for message in the
     view can be customized; e.g.  (set-face-attribute
     'mu4e-view-body-face nil :font "Liberation Serif-10")
   - add `mu4e-action-show-thread`, an action for the headers and view
     buffers to search for messages in the same thread as the current
     one.
   - allow for transforming mailing-list names for display, using
     `mu4e-mailing-list-patterns'.
   - some optimizations in indexing (~30% faster in some cases)
   - new variable mu4e-user-agent-string, to customize the User-Agent:
     header.
   - when removing the "In-reply-to" header from replies, mu4e will
     also remove the (hidden) References header, effectively creating
     a new message-thread.
   - implement 'mu4e-context', for defining and switching between
     various contexts, which are groups of settings. This can be used
     for instance for switch between e-mail accounts. See the section
     in the manual for details.
   - correctly decode mailing-list headers
   - allow for "fancy" mark-characters; and improve the default set
   - by default, the maildirs are no longer cached; please see the
     variable ~mu4e-cache-maildir-list~ if you have a lot of maildirs
     and it gets slow.
   - change the default value for
     ~org-mu4e-link-query-in-headers-mode~ to ~nil~, ie. by default
     link to the message, not the query, as this is usually more useful
     behavior.
   - overwrite target message files that already exist, rather than
     erroring out.
   - set mu4e-view-html-plaintext-ratio-heuristic to 5, as 10 was too
     high to detect some effectively html-only messages
   - add mu4e-view-toggle-html (keybinding: 'h') to toggle between
     text and html display. The existing 'mu4e-view-toggle-hide-cited'
     gets the new binding '#'.
   - add a customization variable `mu4e-view-auto-mark-as-read'
     (defaults to t); if set to nil, mu4e won't mark messages as read
     when you open them. This can be useful on read-only file-systems,
     since marking-as-read implies a file-move operation.
   - use smaller chunks for mu server on Cygwin, allowing for better
     mu4e support there.

*** mu/mu4e/guile

    - NEWS (this file) is now visible from within mu4e – "N" in the main-menu.

    - make `mu4e-headers-sort-field', `mu4e-headers-sort-direction'
      public (that, is change the prefix from mu4e~ to mu4e-), so
      users can manipulate them

    - make it possible the 'fancy' (unicode) characters separately for
      headers and marks (see the variable `mu4e-use-fancy-chars'.)

    - allow for composing in a separate frame (see
      `mu4e-compose-in-new-frame')

    - add the `:thread-subject' header field, for showing the subject
      for a thread only once. So, instead of (from the manual):

      #+END_EXAMPLE

      This is a feature known from e.g. `mutt' and `gnus` and many
      other clients, and can be enabled by customizing
      `mu4e-headers-fields' (replacing `:subject' with `:thread-subject')

      It's not the default yet, but may become so in the future.

    - add some spam-handling actions to mu4e-contrib.el

    - mu4e now targets org 8.x, which support for previous versions
      relegated to `org-old-mu4e.el`. Some of the new org-features are
      improved capture templates.

    - updates to the documentation, in particular about using BBDB.

    - improved URL-handling (use emacs built-in functionality)

    - many bug fixes, including some crash fixes on BSD

*** guile

    – add --delete option to the find-dups scripts, to automatically
    delete them. Use with care!

** Release 0.9.12

*** mu

    - truncate /all/ terms the go beyond xapian's max term length
    - lowercase the domain-part of email addresses in mu cfind (and mu4e), if
      the domain is in ascii
    - give messages without msgids fake-message-ids; this fixes the problem
      where such messages were not found in --include-related queries
    - cleanup of the query parser
    - provide fake message-ids for messages without it; fixes #183
    - allow showing tags in 'mu find' output
    - fix CSV quoting

    - split org support in org-old-mu4e.el (org <= 7.x) and org-mu4e.el
    - org: improve template keywords
    - rework URL handling

** Release 0.9.5

*** mu

     - allow 'contact:' as a shortcut in queries for 'from:foo OR to:foo OR
       cc:foo OR bcc:foo', and 'recip:' as a shortcut for 'to:foo OR
       cc:foo OR bcc:foo'
     - support getting related messages (--include-related), which includes
       messages that may not match the query, but that are in the same threads
       as messages that were
     - support "list:"/"v:" for matching mailing list names, and the "v"
       format-field to show them. E.g 'mu find list:emacs-orgmode.gnu.org'

*** mu4e

    - scroll down in message view takes you to next message (but see
      `mu4e-view-scroll-to-next')
    - support 'human dates', that is, show the time for today's messages, and
      the date for older messages in the headers view
    - replace `mu4e-user-mail-address-regexp' and `mu4e-my-mail-addresses' with
      `mu4e-user-mail-address-list'
    - support tags (i.e.., X-Keywords and friends) in the headers-view, and the
      message view. Thanks to Abdó Roig-Maranges. New field ":tags".
    - automatically update the headers buffer when new messages are found during
      indexing; set `mu4e-headers-auto-update' to nil to disable this.
    - update mail/index with M-x mu4e-update-mail-and-index; which everywhere in
      mu4e is available with key C-S-u. Use prefix argument to run in
      background.
    - add function `mu4e-update-index' to only update the index
    - add 'friendly-names' for mailing lists, so they should up nicely in the
      headers view

*** guile

    - add 'mu script' command to run mu script, for example to do statistics on
      your message corpus. See the mu-script man-page.

     symlinks, use --format=links. This is a change in the options.
   - search output can include the message size using the 'z' shortcut
   - match message size ranges (i.e.. size:500k..2M)
   - fix: honor the --overwrite (or lack thereof) parameter
   - support folder names with special characters (@, ' ', '.' and so on)
   - better check for already-running mu index
   - when --maildir= is not provided for mu index, default to the last one
   - add --max-msg-size, to specify a new maximum message size
   - move the 'mug' UI to toys/mug; no longer installable
   - better support for Solaris builds, Gentoo.

** Release 0.9.1 <2010-12-05 Sun>

   - Add missing icon for mug
   - Fix unit tests (Issue #30)
   - Fix Fedora 14 build (broken GTK+ 3) (Issue #31)

** Release 0.9 <2010-12-04 Sat>

   - you can now search for the message priority ('prio:high', 'prio:low',
     'prio:normal')
   - you can now search for message flags, e.g. 'flag:attach' for messages with
     attachment, or 'flag:encrypted' for encrypted messages
   - you can search for time-intervals, e.g. 'date:2010-11-26..2010-11-29' for
     messages in that range. See the mu-find(1) and mu-easy(1) man-pages for
     details and examples.
   - you can store bookmarked queries in ~/.mu/bookmarks
   - the 'flags' parameter has been renamed in 'flag'
   - add a simple graphical UI for searching, called 'mug'
   - fix --clearlinks for file systems without entry->d_type (fixes issue #28)
   - make matching case-insensitive and accent-insensitive (accent-insensitive
     for characters in Unicode Blocks 'Latin-1 Supplement' and 'Latin
     Extended-A')
   - more extensive pre-processing is done to make searching for email-addresses
     and message-ids less likely to not work (issue #21)
   - updated the man-pages
   - experimental support for Fedora 14, which uses GMime 2.5.x (fixes issue #29)

** Release 0.8 <2010-10-30 Sat>

   - There's now 'mu extract' for getting information about MIME-parts
     (attachments) and extracting them
   - Queries are now internally converted to lowercase; this solves some of the
     false-negative issues
   - All mu sub-commands now have their own man-page
   - 'mu find' now takes a --summary-len=<n> argument to print a summary of
     up-to-n lines of the message
   - Same for 'mu view'; the summary replaces the full body
   - Setting the mu home dir now goes with -m, --muhome
   - --log-stderr, --reindex, --rebuild, --autoupgrade, --nocleanup, --mode,
     --linksdir, --clearlinks lost their single char version

** Release 0.7 <2010-02-27 Sat>

   - Database format changed
   - Automatic database scheme version check, notifies users when an upgrade
     is needed
   - 'mu view', to view mail message files
   - Support for >10K matches
   - Support for unattended upgrades - that is, the database can automatically
     by upgraded (--autoupgrade). Also, the log file is automatically cleaned
     when it gets too big (unless you use --nocleanup)
   - Search for a certain Maildir using the maildir:,m: search prefixes. For
     example, you can find all messages located in ~/Maildir/foo/bar/cur/msg
     ~/Maildir/foo/bar/new/msg and with
	m:/foo/bar
     this replace the search for path/p in 0.6
   - Fixes for reported issues ()
   - A test suite with a growing number of unit tests


** Release 0.6 <2010-01-23 Sat>

# Welcome to mu!

<img src="mu.jpg" align="right" margin="10px"/>
With the *enormous* amounts of e-mail many people gather and the
importance of e-mail messages in our daily work-flow, it is very
important to be able to quickly deal with all that - in particular,
to instantly find that one important e-mail you need right now.

For that, *mu* was created.  *mu* is a tool for dealing with e-mail
messages stored in the
[Maildir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir)-format, on Unix-like
systems. *mu*'s main purpose is to help you to find the messages you
need, quickly; in addition, it allows you to view messages, extract
attachments, create new maildirs, ... See the
[mu cheatsheet](cheatsheet.html) for some examples. Mu's source code
is available [in github](https://github.com/djcb/mu), and there is the
[mu-discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/mu-discuss) mailing list.

*mu* includes an emacs-based e-mail client (`mu4e`), a simple GUI
(`mug`) and bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language.

## Features

- fast indexing for [Maildir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir), Maildir+ and Maildir-on-VFAT
- search for messages based on the sender, receiver, subject, date-range,
size, priority, words in message, flags (signed, encrypted, new, replied,
has-attachment,...), message-id, maildir, tags, attachment (name,
mime-type, text) and more
- support for encrypted and signed messages
- command-line tools for indexing, searching, viewing, adding/removing
messages, extracting attachments, exporting/searching address lists,
creating maildirs, ...
- accent/case normalization - so *angstrom* matches *Ångström*
- can be integrated with other e-mail clients such as
[mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) and
[Wanderlust](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WanderLust).
- [mu4e](mu4e.html), an emacs-based e-mail client based on `mu` (see screenshot).
- [mu-guile](mu-guile.html):
[guile 2.0](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) bindings that
allow for scripting, advanced processing of your data, and doing
all kinds of statistics
- fully documented (man pages, info pages)

## News

### 2016-12-05: mu/mu4e 0.9.18 is available

mu 0.9.18 offers a number of improvements across the board. For
example, people with huge maildirs can use a special "lazy-checking"
mode to speed up indexing; it's now possible to view rich-text message
in an embedded webkit-view, and the release adds support for org-mode
9.x. There also many small fixes and tweaks in mu4e, all based on
user-feedback.

For all the details,
see: [NEWS.org](https://github.com/djcb/mu/blob/0.9.18/NEWS.org).

Get it from the [Release page](https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases).

### 2016-01-21: mu/mu4e 0.9.16 is here, and it is our latest stable release!

#### Better behaviour and context handling
- Context Handling just got smart:  new ‘mu4e-context’ defines and switches between various contexts, which are groups of settings. This may be used for instance to easily configure and switch between multiple accounts.
- Improved behaviour in html and messages marks: ability to toggle between html and text display of messages & better management of messages marked as read or unread. 

#### User Interface improvements
- Numerous improvements in threads view and mailing lists management
- Fancy characters can now be properly used as well as special customizations for message views

#### Faster Indexing and message management
- Indexing & caching optimizations

You can grab the tarball directly
[from Github](https://github.com/djcb/mu-releases) or wait a bit to
get it through your distribution channels (details may vary from one
distribution to another).

None of this would be possible without a team of dedicated
individuals: Adam Sampson, Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason, Bar Shirtcliff,
Charles-H. Schulz, Clément Pit--Claudel, Damien Cassou, Declan Qian,
Dima Kogan, Dirk-Jan C. Binnema, Foivos, Foivos S. Zakkak, Hinrik Örn
Sigurðsson, jeroen tiebout, JJ Asghar, Jonas Bernoulli, Jun Hao,
Martin Yrjölä, Maximilian Matthé, Piotr Trojanek, prsarv, Thierry
Volpiatto, Titus von der Malsburg (and of course all people who
reported issues, provided suggestions etc.)

We hope you will enjoy this release as much as we do. Happy Hacking!

.SH NAME 

mu index \- index e-mail messages stored in Maildirs

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B mu index [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmu index\fR is the \fBmu\fR sub-command for scanning the contents of
Maildir directories and storing the results in a Xapian database which can
then be searched using
.BR mu-find(1)
\.

.B index
understands Maildirs as defined by Daniel Bernstein for qmail(7). In addition,
it understands recursive Maildirs (Maildirs within Maildirs), Maildir++. It
can also deal with VFAT-based Maildirs which use '!' as the seperators instead
of ':' as used by Tinymail/Modest and some other e-mail programs.

E-mail messages which are not stored in something resembling a maildir leaf
directory (\fIcur\fR and \fInew\fR) are ignored.

Symlinks are not followed.

If there is a file called \fI.noindex\fR in a directory, the contents of that
directory and all of its subdirectories will be ignored. This can be useful to
exclude certain directories from the indexing process, for example directories
with spam-messages.

The first run of \fBmu index\fR may take a few minutes if you have a lot of
mail (ten thousands of messages).  Fortunately, such a full scan needs to be
done only once, after that it suffices to index the changes, which goes much
faster. Also note that a substantial amount of the time goes to printing the
progress information; if you turn that off (with \fB\-q\fR or
\fB\-\-quiet\fR), it goes a lot faster. See the 'Note on performance' below
for more information.

The optional phase two of the indexing-process is the removal of messages from
the database for which there is no longer a corresponding file in the
Maildir. If you do not want this, you can use \fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nocleanup\fR.

When \fBmu index\fR catches on of the signals \fBSIGINT\fR, \fBSIGHUP\fR or
\fBSIGTERM\fR (e.g,, when you press Ctrl-C during the indexing process), it
tries to shutdown gracefully; it tries to save and commit data, and close the
database etc. If it receives another signal (e.g,, when pressing Ctrl-C once
more), \fBmu index\fR will terminate immediately.

.SH OPTIONS

Note, some of the important options are described in the \fBmu(1)\fR man-page
and not here, as they apply to multiple mu-commands.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maildir\fR=\fI<maildir>\fR
starts searching at \fI<maildir>\fR. By default, \fBmu\fR uses whatever the
\fBMAILDIR\fR environment variable is set to; if that is not set, it tries
\fI~/Maildir\fR \. In either case, the path must be \fBabsolute\fR.

Also please see the note on mixing sub-maildirs below.

.TP
\fB\-\-reindex\fR
re-index all mails, even ones that are already in the database.

.TP
\fB\-\-nocleanup\fR
disables the database cleanup that \fBmu\fR does by default after indexing.

.TP
\fB\-\-rebuild\fR
clear all messages from the database before
indexing. This is effectively the same as removing the database. The
difference with \fB\-\-reindex\fR is that \fB\-\-rebuild\fR guarantees that
after the indexing has finished, there are no 'old' messages in the database
anymore, which is not true with \fB\-\-reindex\fR when indexing only a part of
messages (using \fB\-\-maildir\fR). For this reason, it is necessary to run
\fBmu index \-\-rebuild\fR when there is an upgrade in the database
format. \fBmu index\fR will issue a warning about this.

.TP
\fB\-\-autoupgrade\fR automatically use \fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-empty\fR
when \fBmu\fR notices that the database version is not up-to-date. This option
is for use in cron scripts and the like, so they won't require any user
interaction, even when mu introduces a new database vesion.

.TP

.B NOTE:
It is probably not a good idea to run multiple instances of
.B mu index
concurrently. No data loss should occur, but one or more of the instances may
experience errors due to database locks.

Also note that, before indexing is completed, searches for messages may fail,
even if they have already been indexed, as some of the esssential database
information will only be written in batches during the indexing process.

Furthermore, it is not recommended tot mix maildirs and sub-maildirs within
the hierarchy in the same database; for example, it's better not to index both
with \fB\-\-maildir\fR=~/MyMaildir and \fB\-\-maildir\fR=~/MyMaildir/foo, as
this may lead to unexpected results when searching with the the 'maildir:'
search parameter (see below).

.SS A note on performance
As a non-scientific benchmark, a simple test on the authors machine (a
Thinkpad X61s laptop using Linux 2.6.31 and an ext3 file system) with no
existing database, and a maildir with 14,200 messages:

.nf
 $ sudo sh -c 'sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
 $ time mu index --quiet
 83.36s user 6.49s system 43% cpu 3:26.21 total
.si
(about 69 messages per second)

A second run, which is the more typical use case when there is a database
already, goes much faster:

.nf
 $ sudo sh -c 'sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
 $ time mu index --quiet
 0.29s user 0.62s system 14% cpu 6.409 total
.si
(about 2219 message per second)

Note that each of test flushes the caches first; a more common use case might
be to run \fBmu index\fR when new mail has arrived; the cache may stay
quite 'warm' in that case:

.nf
 $ time mu index --quiet
0.19s user 0.21s system 98% cpu 0.402 total
.si
which is more than 35,0000 messages per second (there is some variance here,
but the author has not seen it getting under 30,0000 messages per second).

.SH FILES
By default, \fBmu index\fR stores its message database in \fI~/.mu/xapian\fR;
the database has an embedded version number, and \fBmu\fR will automatically
update it when it notices a different version. This allows for automatic
updating of \fBmu\fR-versions, without the need to clear out any old
databases.

However, note that versions of \fBmu\fR before 0.7 used a different scheme,
which put the database in \fI~/.mu/xapian\-<version>\fR. These older databases
can safely be deleted. Starting from version 0.7, this manual cleanup should
no longer be needed.

By default, \fBmu\fR stores logs of its operations and queries in \fI~/.mu/mu.log\fR.
Upon startup, \fBmu\fR checks the size of this log file. If it exceeds 1 MB,
it will be moved to \fI~/.mu/mu.log.old\fR, overwriting any existing file of
that name, and start with an empty \fI~/.mu/mu.log\fR. This scheme allows for
continued use of \fBmu\fR without the need for any manual maintenance of log
files.

To store these files elsewhere from their default location, one can use the
\fI\-\-muhome\fR option, as discussed in the \fBmu\fR-manpage.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

\fBmu index\fR uses \fBMAILDIR\fR to find the user's Maildir if it has not
been specified explicitly with \fB\-\-maildir\fR=\fI<maildir>\fR. If MAILDIR
is not set, \fBmu index\fR will try \fI~/Maildir\fR.

* NAME

mu-bookmarks - file with bookmarks (shortcuts) for *mu* search expressions

* DESCRIPTION

Bookmarks are named shortcuts for search queries. They allow using a convenient
name for often-used queries. The bookmarks are also visible as shortcuts in the
*mu* experimental user interfaces, =mug= and =mug2=.

The bookmarks file is read from _<muhome>/bookmarks_. On Unix this would typically
be _~/.config/mu/bookmarks_, but this can be influenced using the *--muhome*
parameter for {{{man-link(mu-find,1)}}}.

The bookmarks file is a typical key=value *.ini*-file, which is best shown by
means of an example:

#+begin_example
[mu]
inbox=maildir:/inbox                  # inbox
oldhat=maildir:/archive subject:hat   # archived with subject containing 'hat'
#+end_example

The *[mu]* group header is required. For practical uses of bookmarks, see
{{{man-link(mu-find,1)}}}.

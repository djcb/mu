* NAME

mu-view - display an e-mail message file

* SYNOPSIS

*mu* [​_COMMON OPTIONS_​] *view* [​_OPTIONS_​] [​_FILE_...]

* DESCRIPTION

*mu view* is the *mu* command for displaying e-mail message files. It works on
message files and does _not_ require the message to be indexed in the database.

The command shows some common headers (From:, To:, Cc:, Bcc:, Subject: and
Date:), the list of attachments and either the plain-text or html body of the
message (if any), or its s-expression representation.

If no message file is provided, the command reads the message from
standard-input.

* VIEW OPTIONS

** -o, --format _format_
Use the given output format, one of:

- *plain*: use the plain-text body; this is the default,
- *html*: use the HTML body,
- *sexp*: show the S-expression representation of the message.

** --summary-len _number_
Instead of displaying the full message, output a summary based upon the first
_number_ lines of the message.

** --terminate
Terminate messages with \\​f (=form-feed=) characters when displaying them. This is
useful when you want to further process them.

** --decrypt
Attempt to decrypt encrypted message bodies. This is only possible if *mu*
was built with crypto-support.

** --auto-retrieve
Attempt to retrieve crypto-keys automatically from the network, when needed.

.SH NAME 

mu \- index and search the contents of e-mail messages stored in Maildirs

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B mu index [options]

.B mu find  [options] <search expression>

.B mu mkdir [options] <dir> [<dirs>]

.B mu [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmu\fR is a set of tools for indexing and searching e-mail messages stored
in Maildirs. It does so by recursively scanning a Maildir directory tree and
analyzing the e-mail messages found. The results of this analysis are then
stored in a database, which can then be queried for specific messages. 

\fBmu\fR can be used from the command line or can be integrated with e-mail
clients. This manpage has some examples.

The various tools are available as commands for a single \fBmu\fR executable.

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS

\fBmu\fR offers a number of general options that apply to all commands:

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-muhome\fR
causes \fBmu\fR to use an alternative directory to
store and read its database and logs. By default, \fI~/.mu\fR is used.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
makes \fBmu\fR generate extra debug information,
useful for debugging the program itself. By default, debug information goes to
the log file, \fI~/.mu/mu.log\fR. It can safely be deleted when \fBmu\fR is
not running.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
causes \fBmu\fR not to output informational
messages and progress information to standard output, but only to the log
file. Error messages will still be sent to standard error. Note that \fBmu
index\fR is \fBmuch\fR faster with \fB\-\-quiet\fR, so it is recommended you
use this option when using \fBmu\fR from scripts etc.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-log-stderr\fR
causes \fBmu\fR not to output all log messages
to standard error, in addition to sending them to the log file.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
outputs the \fBmu\fR-version and copyright
information.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
list the various command line options, while
\fB\-\-help\-index\fR, \fB\-\-help\-find\fR and \fB\-\-help\-all\fR list only
the options for one command, or all of the commands.


.SH COMMANDS

\fBmu\fR offers the following commands:

.TP
\fBindex\fR
for indexing (analyzing) the contents of your Maildirs, and storing the
information in a database

.TP
\fBfind\fR
for finding messages in your database, using certain search parameters (see
below for details). You can use \fBquery\fR and \fBsearch\fR as synonyms for
\fBfind\fR.

.TP
\fBmkdir\fR
for creating Maildirs.

.SH THE INDEX COMMAND

Using the
.B index
command, you can index your Maildir directories, and store the information in
a Xapian database. 

.B index
understands Maildirs as defined by Dan Bernstein for qmail(7). It also
understands recursive Maildirs (Maildirs within Maildirs), and the
VFAT-version of Maildir, as used by Tinymail/Modest.

E-mail messages which are not stored in something that looks like a Maildir
leaf directory (\fIcur\fR and \fInew\fR) are ignored.

Currently, symlinks are not followed.

If there is a file called
.B .noindex
in a directory, the contents of that directory and any of its subdirectories
will be ignored. This can be useful to exclude certain directories from the
indexing process, for example directories with spam-messages. 

The first run of 
.B mu index
may take a few minutes if you have a lot of mail (ten thousands of messages).
Fortunately, such a full scan needs to be done only once, after that it
suffices to index the changes, which goes much faster. Also note that a
substantial amount of the time goes to printing the progress information; if
you turn that off (with \fB\-q\fR or \fB\-\-quiet\fR), it goes a lot faster.

Phase two of the indexing-process is the removal of messages from the database
for which there is no longer a corresponding file in the Maildir. If you do
not want this, you can use \fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-nocleanup\fR.

.SS Indexing options

.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maildir\fR=\fI<maildir>\fR
starts searching at \fI<maildir>\fR. By default,
\fBmu\fR uses whatever the
.B MAILDIR
environment variable is set to; if that is not set, it tries
.B ~/Maildir
\.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reindex\fR
re-index all mails, even ones that are already in the database.

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-nocleanup\fR
disables the database cleanup that \fBmu\fR does by default after indexing.


.TP

.B NOTE:
It is probably not a good idea to run multiple instances of
.B mu index
concurrently. No data loss should occur, but one or more of the instances may
experience errors due to database locks.

Also note that, before indexing is completed, searches for messages may fail,
even if they have already been indexed, as some of the esssential database
information will only be written in batches during the indexing process.

.SH THE FIND COMMAND

The
.B find
command starts a search for messages in the database that match the search
pattern. Currently, the maximum number of matches for any query is 10,000
messages.

The search pattern is taken as a command line parameter. If the search
parameter consists of multiple parts (multiple command line parameters) they
are treated as if there were a logical \fBAND\fR between them.

If you want to make your own constructions (using \fBAND\fR, \fBOR\fR,
\fBNOT\fR etc., you have to put quote them so \fBmu\fR can consider them as a
unit.

\fBmu\fR relies on the Xapian database for its searching capabilities, so it
offers all the search functionality that Xapian offers; please refer to:

     \fIhttp://xapian.org/docs/queryparser.html\fR

The basic way to search a message is to type some words matching it, as you
would do in a search engine on the internet, ie.	

.nf
	mu find monkey banana
.fi

will find all message that have both 'monkey' and 'banana'. Matching is
case-insensitive and somewhat intelligent, in that it tries to recognize
various forms of a word (such as plulars); this is all courtesy of Xapina.

\fBmu\fR also recognizes prefixes for specific fields in a messages; for
example:

.nf
	mu find subject:penguin
.fi

to find messages with have the word \fBpenguin\fR in the subject field. You
can abbreviate \fBsubject:\fR to just \fBs:\fR. Here is the full table of the
search fields and their abbreviations:

.nf
	cc,c            CC (Carbon-Copy) recipient
	from,f          Message sender
	path,p          Full path to the message
	subject,s       Message subject
	to,t            To: recipient
	msgid,m         Message-ID
.fi


.SS Find options

The \fBfind\fR-command has various options that influence the way \fBmu\fR
displays the results. If you don't specify anything, the defaults are
\fI\-\-fields="d f s"\fR, \fI\-\-sortfield=date\fR and \fI\-\-descending\fR.   

.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fields\fR=\fI<fields>\fR
specifies a string that determines which fields are shown in the output. This
string consists of a number of characters (such as 's' for subject or 'f' for
from), which will replace with the actual field in the output. Fields that are
not known will be output as-is, allowing for some simple formatting.

For example:
.nf
	mu find subject:snow --fields "d f s"
.fi
would list the date, subject and sender of all messages with 'snow' in the
their subject.

The table of replacement characters is superset of the list mentions for
search parameters:

.nf
	t	To: recipient
	c	CC (Carbon-Copy) recipient
	d	Sent date of the message
	f	Message sender (From:)
	F	Message flags
	p	Full path to the message
	P	Message priority (high, normal, low)      
	s	Message subject
	m       Message ID
	t	To: recipient
.fi

The message-flags output is a string, consisting of zero or more of the
following characters.

.nf
	D	Draft Message
	F	Flagged
	N	New message (in new/ Maildir)
	P	Passed ('Handled')
	R	Replied
	S	Seen
	T	Marked for deletion
	a	Has attachment
	s	Signed message
	x	Encrypted message
.fi

Note that these are theoretical flags, which may or may not be actually in
use.
 
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sortfield\fR \fR=\fI<field>\fR and \fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-descending\fR
specifies the field to sort the search results by, and the direction. The
following fields are supported:

.nf
	cc,c            CC (Carbon-Copy) recipient
	date,d          message sent date
	from,f          message sender
	msgid,m         message id
	path,p          full path to the message
	prio,P          message priority
	subject,s       message subject
	to,t            To:-recipient
.fi

Thus, for example, to sort messages by date, you could specify:

.nf
  $ mu find fahrrad --fields "d f s" --sortfield=date --descending
.fi

Note, if you specify a sortfield, by default, they are sorted in descending
order (e.g., from lowest to highest). This is usually a good choice, but for
dates it may be more useful to sort in the opposite direction.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xquery\fR
shows the Xapian query corresponding to your search terms. This is mostly
useful for debugging.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-linksdir\fR \fR=\fI<dir>\fR and \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clearlinks\fR
output the results as a maildir with symbolic links to the found
messages. This enables easy integration with mail-clients (see below for more
information). \fBmu\fR will create the maildir if it does not exist yet.

If you specify \fB\-\-clearlinks\fR, all existing symlinks will be cleared
from the target maildir; this allows for re-use of the same directory. An
alternative would be to delete the target directory before, but this has a big
chance of accidentaly removing something that should not be removed.

.nf
  $ mu find grolsch --linksdir=~/Maildir/search --clearlinks
.fi

will store links to found messages in \fI~/Maildir/search\fR. If the directory
does not exist yet, it will be created.

Note: when \fBmu\fR creates a Maildir for these links, it automatically
inserts a \fI.noindex\fR file, to exclude the directory from \fBmu
index\fR.


.SS Example queries

Here are some simple examples of \fBmu\fR search queries; you can make many
more complicated queries using various logical operators, parentheses and so
on, but in the author's experience, it's usually faster to find a message with
a simple query just searching for some words.

Find all messages with both 'bee' and 'bird' (in any field)

.nf
  $ mu find 'bee AND bird'
.fi

or shorter, because \fBAND\fR is implied:

.nf
  $ mu find bee bird
.fi

Find all messages with either Frodo or Sam:

.nf
  $ mu find 'Frodo OR Sam'
.fi

Find all messages with the 'wombat' as subject, and 'capibara' anywhere:

.nf
  $ mu find subject:wombat capibara
.fi

Find all messages in the 'Archive' folder from Fred:

.nf
  $ mu find from:fred path:archive
.fi


.SS Integrating mu find with mail clients

.TP

\fBmutt\fR
For \fBmutt\fR you can use the following in your \fImuttrc\fR; pressing the F8
key will start a search, and F9 will take you to the results.

.nf
# mutt macros for mu
macro index <F8> "<shell-escape>mu find -c -l ~/Maildir/search " \
					"mu find"
macro index <F9> "<change-folder-readonly>~/Maildir/search" \
					"display mu find results"
.fi


.TP

\fBWanderlust\fR
If you use Wanderlust for \fBemacs\fR, the following definitons can be used;
typing 'Q' will start a query.

.nf
;; mu integration for Wanderlust
(defvar mu-wl-mu-program     "mu")
(defvar mu-wl-search-folder  "search")

(defun mu-wl-search ()
  "search for messages with `mu', and jump to the results"
  (interactive)
  (let* ((muexpr (read-string "Find messages matching: "))
	  (sfldr  (concat elmo-maildir-folder-path "/"
		    mu-wl-search-folder))
	  (cmdline (concat mu-wl-mu-program " find "
		      "--clearlinks --linksdir='" sfldr "' "
		     muexpr)))
    (= 0 (shell-command cmdline))))

(defun mu-wl-search-and-goto ()
  "search and jump to the folder with the results"
  (interactive)
  
  (if (mu-wl-search)
    (wl-summary-goto-folder-subr
      (concat "." mu-wl-search-folder)
      'force-update nil nil t)
    (message "Query failed")))
.fi


.SH THE MKDIR COMMAND

With the
.B mkdir
command, you can create new Maildirs with permissions 0755. For example,

.nf
   mu mkdir tom dick harry
.fi

will create three Maildirs \fItom\fR, \fIdick\fR and \fIharry\fR.

If the creation somehow fails, for safety reasons, \fBno\fR attempt is made to
remove any parts that were created.

.SH FILES
By default, \fBmu index\fR stores its message database in
\fI~/.mu/xapian-<version>\fR, where \fI<version>\fR is the version of the
database layout, which is not necessarily the same as the \fBmu\fR version
number.

\fBmu\fR stores logs of its operations in \fI~/.mu/mu.log\fR. These can grow
quite big when using the \fI\-\-debug\fR option, but they can be safely
delete when \fBmu\fR is not running.

To store various \fBmu\fR-files elsewhere from their default location, one can
use the \fI\-\-muhome\fR option, as discussed in the \fBGENERAL OPTIONS\fR
section.


.SH ENVIRONMENT

As mentioned, \fBmu index\fR uses \fBMAILDIR\fR to find the user's Maildir if
it has not been specified explicitly \fB\-\-maildir\fR=\fI<maildir>\fR. If
MAILDIR is not set, \fBmu index\fR will try \fI~/Maildir\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmu\fR is a set of tools for dealing with Maildirs and the e-mail messages
in them.

\fBmu\fR's main function is to enable searching of e-mail messages. It does so
by periodically scanning a Maildir directory tree and analyzing the e-mail
messages found ('indexing'). The results of this analysis are stored in a
database, which can then be queried.

In addition to indexing and searching, \fBmu\fR also offers functionality for
viewing messages, extracting attachments and creating maildirs, and searching
and exporting contact information.

\fBmu\fR can be used from the command line or can be integrated with various
e-mail clients.

This manpage gives a general overview of the available commands
(\fBindex\fR, \fBfind\fR, etc.); each \fBmu\fR command has its own
man-page as well.

.SH COMMANDS

\fBmu\fR offers the following commands:

.TP
\fBindex\fR
for indexing (analyzing) the contents of your Maildirs, and storing the
information in a database. See
.BR mu-index(1)
\.

.TP
\fBfind\fR
for finding messages in your database, using certain search
parameters. See
.BR mu-find(1)
\.


.TP
\fBcfind\fR
for finding contacts (names + e-mail addresses) matching a certain expression,
and exporting the results in various formats for use in other programs.
.BR mu-cfind(1)
\.

.TP
\fBview\fR
for displaying e-mail messages. See
.BR mu-view(1)
\.

.TP
\fBmkdir\fR
for creating Maildirs. See
.BR mu-mkdir(1)
\.

.TP
\fBextract\fR
for extract MIME-parts (such as attachments) from messages. See
.BR mu-extract(1)
\.

.SH COLORS

Some \fBmu\fR sub-commands support colorized output. If you don't want this,
you can use the \fI--nocolor\fR/ option to disable it. Even then, colors will
only be shown when output goes to a sufficiently capable terminal (this roughly
mirrors the \fI--color=auto\fR of the GNU-version of the \fBls\fR-command).

Instead of the \fI--color\fR/, you can also set the \fBMU_NOCOLOR\fR
environment variable to non-empty to disable colors.

Currently, \fBmu find\fR, \fBmu view\fR, \fBmu cfind\fR and \fBmu extract\fR
support colors.

.SH ENCODING

\fBmu\fR's output is in the current locale, with the exceptions of the output
specifically meant for output to UTF8-encoded files. In practice, this means
that the output of commands \fBindex\fR, \fBview\fR,
\fBextract\fR is always encoded according to the current locale.

The same is true for \fBfind\fR and \fBcfind\fR, with some exceptions, where
the output is always UTF-8, regardless of the locale.

For \fBcfind\fR the exception is \fI--format=bbdb\fR. This is hard-coded to
UTF-8, and as such specified in the output-file, so emacs/bbdb can handle it
correctly without guessing.

For \fBfind\fR the output is encoded according the locale for
\fI--format=plain\fR (the default), and UTF-8 for all other formats
(\fIjson\fR, \fIsexp\fR, \fIxml\fR).

.SH DATABASE AND FILE

Commands \fBmu index\fR and \fBfind\fR and \fBcfind\fR work with the database,
while the other ones work on invidual mail files. Hence, running \fBview\fR,
\fBmkdir\fR and \fBextract\fR does not require the mu database.

The various commands are discussed in more detail in their own separate
man-pages; here the general options are discussed.

.SH OPTIONS

\fBmu\fR offers several general options that apply to all commands,
including \fBmu\fR without any command.

.TP
\fB\-\-muhome\fR
causes \fBmu\fR to use an alternative directory to
store and read its database and logs. By default, \fI~/.mu\fR is used.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
makes \fBmu\fR generate extra debug information,
useful for debugging the program itself. By default, debug information goes to
the log file, \fI~/.mu/log/mu.log\fR. It can safely be deleted when \fBmu\fR is
not running. When running with \fB--debug\fR option, the log file can grow
rather quickly. See the note on logging below.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
causes \fBmu\fR not to output informational
messages and progress information to standard output, but only to the log
file. Error messages will still be sent to standard error. Note that \fBmu
index\fR is \fBmuch\fR faster with \fB\-\-quiet\fR, so it is recommended you
use this option when using \fBmu\fR from scripts etc.

.TP
\fB\-\-log-stderr\fR
causes \fBmu\fR to \fBnot\fR output log messages to standard error, in
addition to sending them to the log file.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
prints \fBmu\fR version and copyright information.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
lists the various command line options, while \fB\-\-help\-index\fR,
\fB\-\-help\-find\fR and \fB\-\-help\-all\fR list only the options for
respectively the specified command or for all commands.

.SH ERROR CODES

The various mu subcommands typically exit with 0 (zero) upon success, and
non-zero when some error occurred. The table lists the various error codes.

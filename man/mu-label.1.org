* NAME

mu-label - attach labels to messages. Export labels to file, and import them.

* SYNOPSIS

*mu* [â€‹_COMMON-OPTIONS_â€‹] *label* update [â€‹UPDATE-OPTIONSâ€‹] "<query>" --labels [{+,-}<label>]...

*mu* [â€‹_COMMON-OPTIONS_â€‹] *label* list [LIST-OPTIONS]

mu [â€‹_COMMON-OPTIONS_â€‹] *label* clear [CLEAR-OPTIONS] "<query>"

mu [â€‹_COMMON-OPTIONS_â€‹] *label* export [<file>]

mu [â€‹_COMMON-OPTIONS_â€‹] *label* import <file>

* DESCRIPTION

*mu label* is the sub-command for adding and removing and listing message labels.

A label is a string associated with a message.

*mu label* has five sub-commands (i.e., 'sub-sub-commands'):

- *update* for changing the labels for the messages matching some query
- *clear* for clearing all labels from messages matching some query
- *list* to list all labels that are in use in the store
- *export* to write the label information to a file
- *import* the read label information from a file

Important: unlike other message metadata stored by *mu*, labels _cannot_ be restored
by merely re-indexing messages. Hence, to avoid loosing label information, you
must *export* it before re-indexing, and *import* afterwards.

* UPDATE OPTIONS

The *update* coxmmand changes the labels for messages that match some query. The
query must be recognized as a single parameter; hence, it must be quoted when
using from a shell.

** --labels

  a comma-separated list of labels, each prefixed with either *+* to add that
  label, or *-* to remove it. See *VALID LABELS*.

  *mu4e* users: note the difference, in *mu4e* the label expressions are
  _space_-separated, here they are _comma_-separated.

** --dry-run

  only print what /would/ change, but do not change anything

#+include: "muhome.inc" :minlevel 2

* CLEAR OPTIONS

The *clear* command removes all labels from messages that match some query. As
with *update*, the must be recognized as a single parameter, i.e., quote it when
using from a shell.

** --dry-run

  only print what /would/ change, but do not change anything

#+include: "muhome.inc" :minlevel 2

* LIST OPTIONS

The *list* command lists all the labels that are currently in use in the store.

* EXPORT OPTIONS

The *export* command takes the labels in the store and the messages they apply to,
and writes this information to a file. You can *import* this file later, to
restore the labels. The command takes a path to a file or a directory (ending in
'/') as its argument.

If a file is specified, *mu* writes the export to it.

If a directory is specified, *mu* writes to a file in that directory. The
directory must already exist.

When neither is specified, *mu* writes to a file in the current directory.

See *EXPORT FORMAT* below for details about the format.

* IMPORT OPTIONS

The *import* command is for restoring the labels from a file created through
*export* earlier. The command takes a path to a file as its argument.

See *EXPORT FORMAT* below for details on the format.

** --dry-run

  only print what would change, but do not change anything

#+include: "muhome.inc" :minlevel 2

* VALID LABELS

*mu* does not wish to limit your creativity, but nevertheless puts a few
restrictions on what is accepted as a label.

- a *valid label character* is any character that is not a control-character, a
  blank, or any of *'*, *"*, *`*, */*, *\*, *$*
- a *valid label* consists of one or more valid label characters, the first of
  which must *not* be either *+* or *-*

Hence, some valid labels are: ~project-x~, ~c@pybara~, ~fnðŸ˜ƒrb~, while some _invalid_
ones are: ~holiday plan~ and ~+fancy$/dinner~.

* EXPORT FORMAT

The formats for import/export are UTF-8 encoded text. The first line starts with
~;;~ and some internal data. Empty lines are ignored.

Each entry represents the tags for a message. It consists of three lines. The
first starts with ~path:~ followed by the file-system path to the message. The
second line starts with ~message-id:~ followed by the message-id for the message.
Finally, the third line starts with ~tag:~ followed by space-separated tags for
the message

#+begin_example
path:/home/user/Maildir/inbox/cur/1720645394.99f64f5d81f42ba4.hyperion:2,S
message-id:669338009127192q7821feh1t826d0c4c90bd8fdf@mail.gmail.com
labels:foo,bar,cuux
#+end_example

Note, the ~message-id:~ is only used if the message cannot be found using ~path:~.

This adds some fault-tolerance for the case where the precise file-system
positions have changed since the labels were exported. The upshot of that is
that if there are _duplicate_ messages (messages with the same message-id), the
tags are applied to all of them.

* EXAMPLES

Some examples. For the query parameter, make sure to quote the query to ensure
it is recognized as a single parameter.

Remove the label "planet" and add the label "dwarf-planet" to all messages that
have "pluto" in their subject:
#+begin_export
$ mu label update "subject:pluto" --labels -planet,+dwarf-planet
#+end_export

Clear all labels from messages with the label "boring":
#+begin_export
$ mu label clear "label:boring"
#+end_export

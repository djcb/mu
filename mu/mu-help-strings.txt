<format> is one of:

'plain' is the default.

If you specify '--personal', only addresses that were found in mails
that include 'my' e-mail address will be listed - so to exclude e.g.
mailing-list posts. Use the --my-address= option in 'mu index' to
specify what addresses are considered 'my' address.

With '--after=T' you can tell mu to only show addresses that were seen after
T. T is a Unix timestamp. For example, to get only addresses seen after the
beginning of 2012, you could use
         --after=`date +%%s -d 2012-01-01`

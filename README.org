* Welcome to mu!

  Given the enormous amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance of
  e-mail message in our work-flows, it's essential to quickly deal with all that
  mail - in particular, to instantly find that one important e-mail you need right
  now.

  [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu][mu]] is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the
  Maildir-format. =mu='s purpose in life is to help you to quickly find the
  messages you need; in addition, it allows you to view messages, extract
  attachments, create new maildirs, and so on. See the [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/cheatsheet.html][mu cheatsheet]] for some
  examples. =mu= is fully documented.

  After indexing your messages into a [[http://www.xapian.org][Xapian]]-database, you can search them using
  a custom query language. You can use various message fields or words in the
  body text to find the right messages.

  Built on top of =mu= are some extensions (included in this package):

  - mu-for-emacs ([[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]]): a full-featured e-mail client that runs inside emacs
  - [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu-guile.html][mu-guile]]: bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language (version 2.0
    and later)
  - a toy GTK+-interface called 'mug' (in the 'toys/' subdir)

  =mu= is written in C and a bit of C++ (to interface with Xapian), with =mu4e=
  written in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs-Lisp][Emacs-Lisp]] and =mu-guile= in a mix of C and Scheme.

  Note, =mu= is available in Debian/Ubuntu under the name =maildir-utils=;
  apparently because they don't like short names. It's also possible to confuse
  that name with the [[http://mailutils.org/][GNU Mailutils]] project (which is totally unrelated) - but
  now you have been warned.

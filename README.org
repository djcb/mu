Welcome to ~mu~!

Latest development news: [[NEWS.org]].

With the enormous amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance of
e-mail message in our work-flows, it's essential to quickly deal with all that
mail - in particular, to instantly find that one important e-mail you need right
now, and quickly file away message for later use.

~mu~ is a set of command-line tools for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the
Maildir-format. ~mu~'s goal is to help you to quickly find the messages you need,
view them, extract attachments, create new maildirs, and so on.

After indexing your messages into a [[http://www.xapian.org][Xapian]]-database, you can search them through
a query language. You can use various message fields or words in the body text
to find the right messages.

Built on top of ~mu~ are some extensions (included in this package):

- ~mu4e~: a full-featured e-mail client that runs inside emacs

- ~mu-scm~: bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language (version 3.0 and
  later)

~mu~ is written in C++; ~mu4e~ is written in ~elisp~ and ~mu-scm~ is written in a mix of
C++ and Scheme.

~mu~ is available in many Linux distributions (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora)
under the name ~maildir-utils~; apparently because they don't like short names.
All of the code is distributed under the terms of the [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GNU General Public License
version 3]] (or higher).

* Versions

*mu* attempts to balance development speed and stability. For this, every few
months there is a stable version (e.g. ~1.12.12~); development then continues in
in ~master~, with ~~-dev~ (e.g. ~1.12.13-dev~): ~-dev~-suffixed versions refer to the
current _development_ code, until it is released (and then looses its ~-dev~ suffix,
i.e., become the ~1.12.13~ release).

So if you want stability, grab the [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/][release]]; if you are more
adventurous/impatient, git ~master~ is there as well.

* Installation

Note: building from source is an /advanced/ subject, especially if something goes
wrong. The below simple examples are a start, but all tools involved have many
options; there are differences between systems, versions etc. So if this is all
a bit daunting we recommend to wait for someone else to build it for you, such
as a Linux distribution. Many have packages available.

** Requirements

To be able to build ~mu~, ensure you have:

- a C++17 compiler (~gcc~ and ~clang~ are known to work)
- development packages for /Xapian/ and /GMime/ and /GLib/ (see ~meson.build~ for the
  versions)
- basic tools such as ~make~, ~sed~, ~grep~
- ~meson~

For ~mu4e~, you also need ~emacs~.

Note, support for Windows is very much _experimental_, that is, it works for some
people, but we can't really support it due to lack of the specific expertise.
Help is welcome!

** Building

#+begin_example
$ git clone https://github.com/djcb/mu.git
$ cd mu
#+end_example

~mu~ uses ~meson~ for building, so you can use that directly, and all the usual
commands apply. You can also use it _indirectly_ through the provided ~Makefile~,
which provides a number of useful targets.

For instance, using the ~Makefile~, you could install ~mu~ using:

#+begin_example
$ ./autogen.sh && make
$ sudo make install
#+end_example

You can of course also run ~meson~ directly (see the ~meson~ documentation for more
details):
#+begin_example
$ meson setup build
$ meson compile -C build
$ meson install -C build
#+end_example

** Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See the Github issue list and [[IDEAS.org]].
